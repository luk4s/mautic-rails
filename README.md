RoR helper / wrapper for Mautic API and forms

*Rails 4.2.8+, 5.1+ compatible*
## Usage
### Gem provides API connection to your Mautic(s)
  1. Create mautic connection
  2. Authorize it
      
      In mautic you need add API oauth2 login.
      For URI callback allow:
      ```
      http://localhost:3000/mautic/connections/:ID/oauth2
      ```
      ID = is your Mautic::Connection ID
  
   Find connection which you want to use:
  ```ruby
  m = Mautic::Connection.last
  ```
  Get specify contact:
  ```ruby
  contact = m.contact.find(1) # =>Â #<Mautic::Contact id=1 ...>
  ```
  Collections of contacts:
  ```ruby
  m.contacts.where("gmail").each do |contact|
    #<Mautic::Contact id=12 ...>
    #<Mautic::Contact id=21 ...>
    #<Mautic::Contact id=99 ...>
  end
  ```
  New instance of contacts:
  ```ruby
  contact = m.contacts.new({ email: "newcontactmail@fake.info"} )
  contact.save # => true
  ```
  Update contact
  ```ruby
  contact.email = ""
  contact.save # => false
  contact.errors # => [{"code"=>400, "message"=>"email: This field is required.", "details"=>{"email"=>["This field is required."]}}]
  ```
  Of course you can use more than contact: `assets`, `emails`, `companies`, `forms`, `points` ...
### Gem provides simple Mautic form submit
There are two options of usage:
  1. Use default mautic url from configuration and shortcut class method:
  ```ruby
    # form: ID of form in Mautic *required*
    # url: Mautic URL - default is from configuration
    # request: request object (for domain, and forward IP...) *optional*
    Mautic::FormHelper.submit(form: "mautic form ID") do |i|
      i.form_field1 = "value1"
      i.form_field2 = "value2"
    end
  ``` 
  2. Or create instance
  ```ruby
  # request is *optional*
  m = Mautic::FormHelper.new("https://mymautic.com", request)
  m.data = {} # hash of attributes
  m.push # push data to mautic 
  ```
  
### Webhook receiver
Receive webhook from mautic, parse it and prepare for use.

  1. add concern to your controller
      
          include Mautic::ReceiveWebHooks
  2. in routes must be specify `:mautic_id`, for example:
  
          post "webhook/:mautic_id", action: "webhook", on: :collection
          

## Installation

  config.base_url = "https://my-rails-app.com"
  # OR it can be Proc 
  # *optional* This is your default mautic URL - used in form helper
